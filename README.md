🎓 Project Title: Data Link Layer Simulation using Python & Tkinter
🔧 Tools Used: Python, Tkinter, CRC Algorithm, GUI

🚀 About the Project:
As part of my training in computer networks and data communication, I developed a GUI-based simulation of the Data Link Layer using Python and Tkinter. This project demonstrates how reliable data transfer is achieved between sender and receiver over a noisy channel using framing, error detection (CRC), acknowledgments (ACKs), and sliding window protocol.

📌 Key Features:

✅ Interactive GUI:

Developed using Tkinter with a user-friendly interface.

Real-time status updates for sender and receiver.

Frame visualization including sequence number, data bits, and CRC.

✅ Framing & CRC Error Detection:

Converts text data to binary and adds a CRC checksum using a given polynomial (e.g., 1011).

Ensures data integrity during transmission.

✅ Simulated Noisy Channel:

Users can simulate frame loss and bit errors using checkboxes and probability inputs.

Corrupt or lost frames trigger appropriate retransmission or ACK handling.

✅ Sliding Window Protocol:

Implements a window size (e.g., 3) for efficient frame transmission.

Supports cumulative ACKs and buffered out-of-order frames.

✅ Step-by-Step Simulation:

Users can observe each step of data transmission and acknowledgment manually, making it great for learning and teaching.

✅ Robust Logging System:

Visual logs of every action including frame generation, transmission, reception, CRC checking, error detection, ACKs, and more.

🔍 Educational Use Case:
This project is ideal for demonstrating how the Data Link Layer works in a practical, visual, and interactive way. It’s especially useful for:

Students studying Computer Networks

Networking educators

Beginners learning about protocols like Stop-and-Wait, Go-Back-N, or Selective Repeat

🎯 What I Learned:

Designing layered network models practically

CRC algorithm implementation in Python

GUI development with Tkinter

Simulating real-world channel behaviors and error conditions

Protocol logic for sender/receiver buffering and ACK handling
